C header library for access the CPU timestamp cycle counter (TSC) on x86-64. If
not familar with using the TSC for benchmarking, refer to the
[Intel whitepaper][intel1]. This is designed to be used for benchmarking code,
so takes steps to prevent instruction reordering across measurement boundaries
by the CPU.

## Usage

As a header only library, just include `tsc.h` in your include directory of
your project. Then, use as follows:

``` .c
uint64_t start, end, overhead;

overhead = measure_tsc_overhead();

start = bench_start();
// code to benchmark
end = bench_end();

printf("Execution took %" PRIu64 " clock cycles\n", end - start - overhead);
```

## Reading the TSC

Reading the TSC for benchmarking is a confused subject with differing advice on
how to avoid CPU instruction reordering affecting your measurements. A detailed
write up on the issues can be found at the [gotsc][gotsc] project.

## Converting Cycles to Time

To convert from cycles to wall-clock time we need to know TSC frequency
Frequency scaling on modern Intel chips doesn't affect the TSC.

Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a good way to do this. From Intel V3B, 17.14:

> That rate may be set by the maximum core-clock to bus-clock ratio of the
> processor or may be set by the maximum resolved frequency at which the
> processor is booted. The maximum resolved frequency may differ from the
> processor base frequency, see Section 18.15.5 for more detail. On certain
> processors, the TSC frequency may not be the same as the frequency in the
> brand string.

Linux appears to deteremine the TSC clock speed through a [calibration] [lxr3]
against hardware timers.

However, another project claims that the ratio of TSC clock to bus clock can be
read from `MSR_PLATFORM_INFO[15:8]` (see Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developerâ€™s Manual, Vol. 3C 35-53 (pag. 2852)). Need to check this.
